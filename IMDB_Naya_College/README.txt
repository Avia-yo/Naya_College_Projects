I chose to create the project on the IMDB dataset.
In the project I imported the dataset from the kaggle website using the api.

* I also added another part that loads the dataset from csv file (if you prefer that).

As part of the project I cleaned the data by removing columns that contained null values as well as unnecessary columns.
I used utils file that include class that implement methods that arrenge the data by sorting and finding the top values,
using calculations such as sum, average, max values...
finaly, I created 2 plots that visualize the correlation between values in the dataset.
