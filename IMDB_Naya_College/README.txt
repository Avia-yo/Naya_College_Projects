I chose to create the project on the IMDB data set.
In the project I imported the dataset from the kaggle website using the api.

* I also added another part that loads the csv file (if you prefer that).

As part of the project I cleaned the data by: removing columns that contained null values as well as unnecessary columns.
I sorted the data and found the top values.
Calculations were performed such as scheme, average, max values...
I created a visualization of 2 graphs that check correlation between values in the dataset
